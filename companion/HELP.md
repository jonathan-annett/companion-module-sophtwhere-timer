Keys used in the browser
---
<kbd>P</kbd> Turns the controller window into a presenter's window.  <br>
  - *the presenter's window is a cleaner display, without extra distractions*
  - *pressing <kbd>P</kbd> again will restore the presenter's window to a controller window*
  - *everything still works the same in presenter's view mode, but without the visual feedback you get while editing durations and custom text - however a better solution is to use a remote window for the presenter*

<kbd>R</kbd> Toggle display of the remote window <br>
   - *the remote window is a secondary window that you can drag to a second monitor, automatically configured to display the timer in presenter's mode*
   - *this key only works from the controller view mode*
   - *pressing <kbd>R</kbd> again closes the remote window*
   - *the remote window will be closed when you close the controller window*

<kbd>F</kbd> Make the current window full screen. <br>
   - *pressing <kbd>F</kbd> again restores a window from fullscreen mode*
   - *on some systems there are other keys that will also enable full screen, it's fine to use whatever method you like, however, in most cases, you need to use the same method to enter and exit. The <kbd>F</kbd> key is implemented to enter full screen, regardless of what browser or operating system, you are using*

<kbd>O</kbd> Toggle the floating overlay window. <br>

<kbd>S</kbd> This is a shortcut to immediately make turn a controller window into a full screen presenter window ("single screen mode").

About the Timer's Display Modes

Dual Display Mode

In this mode, you will use one browser as a controller display screen, with another browser window which you drag to a spare monitor, and to display a stage timer screen.

  * the controller screen has information which may be useful for an operator

  * the stage timer screen has a countdown timer, intended to be viewed by a presenter. 
  
  * there's an optional progress bar, the time of day, and custom messages entered by the operator.

Overlay Mode

In this mode, you will use a browser as a controller display screen, and a floating "always on top" window which displays the countdown.

  * the floating overlay window only shows the remaining time
